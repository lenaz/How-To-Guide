<h1>Response</h1>

<p>After our request has been properly formatted and sent, we will receive a JSON-formatted response including our Sentiment Analysis:</p>

<p>Just as we did with our request, letâ€™s break the response down into its individual components:</p>

<div class="definitions">

<h2>Response Components</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>status:</strong> OK or ERROR - indicates whether the request was successful.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>url:</strong> HTTP URL that was passed in the input.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>language:</strong> Detected language of the source text (text with fewer than 15 characters is assumed to be English)</li>
<br>
<li><strong>docSentiment:</strong> Object containing document-level sentiment information. It includes the following key-value pairs:</li>
  <br>
<ul>
<li><strong>mixed:</strong> 1 indicates that the sentiment is both positive and negative</li>
<br>
<li><strong>score:</strong> Sentiment strength (0.0 == neutral)</li>
<br>
<li><strong>type:</strong> Sentiment polarity: positive, negative, or neutral</li>
</ul>
  <br>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>When an error occurs, the status attribute of the response will read ERROR, and the statusInfo attribute will contain a string that describes the error.</p>
<h3>Possible Errors Values</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>invalid-api-key:</strong> Value of the  API key parameter is invalid</li>
<br>
<li><strong>cannot-retrieve:</strong> Cannot retrieve the webpage. Contains additional information depending on the reason.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>page-is-not-html:</strong> Input content is not HTML.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>unsupported-text-language:</strong> The method you are using does not support the language of the source text. If the detected language isn't correct (it usually is for text > 100 characters), you can manually specify the language in the language query parameter.</li>
</ul>
</div>
